TimeBound Quiz System is a web-based quiz application developed using Core Java,
JSP, and Servlets. The application provides a real-time quiz experience where
each question must be answered within 60 seconds.

Users receive instant feedback after answering each question, making the quiz
interactive and time-sensitive. This project demonstrates server-side
programming, session handling, and real-time logic implementation using Java
web technologies without using any external frameworks.
